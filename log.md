# #100DaysOfCode Log

### Day 1: Saturday April 20, 2024
**Today's Progress**: I started by reading docs and trying new things in the laravel ecosystem like laravel v11, livewire v3, herd, volt, folio, reverb, etc.

**Thoughts:** I'm already familiar with Laravel, but I need to catch up with the latest technology because in the last 2 years there have been many updates and new packages to make it easier to create a web application.

### Day 2: Sunday April 21, 2024
**Today's Progress**: Created a simple CRUD project using
LLAT stack (Laravel, Livewire, Alpine, Tailwind) or more popularly called  TALL stack and also Mary UI

**Thoughts:** Back to learning basic features such as CRUD because this is the feature that is most often used in web applications and with this I can explore the new features of Livewire v3 such as SPA (yes, PHP can now SPA like JS), validation using PHP attributes and more

### Day 3: Monday April 22, 2024
**Today's Progress**: Finished the simple CRUD project

**Thoughts:** Using livewire volt on the backend and mary UI on the frontend, this is one of the best developer experiences that i have had, livewire volt allows us to create livewire component and html in 1 file, then mary ui has many blade components that are ready to use

### Day 4: Tuesday April 23, 2024
**Today's Progress**: Learned laravel folio which simplifies laravel routes based on folder structure and I also added login and logout functions

**Thoughts:** Using laravel folio + livewire volt simplifies things a lot

### Day 5: Wednesday April 24, 2024
**Today's Progress**: Learned Alpine.JS and created a pomodoro timer.

**Thoughts:** It really highlighted why people are prefer AlpineJS over jQuery, because it's simplicity, reactivity and ease of use.
